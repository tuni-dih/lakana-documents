    <h3>Definitions</h3>

        activities, in addition to those that may have interests in the study or be affected by the results.</h4>

    <h4>Communication material: A communication material is the deliverable produced with the information that will be
        used for communication. </h4>

    <h4>Channel: The channel is the general means of transmission for a given communication / message.</h4>

    <h4>Responsible party: The responsible party is an individual or a group who has overall responsibility and
        accountability for ensuring that a given communication happens.</h4>

    <h3>General instructions</h3>

    <h4>The communication plan for the LAKANA project identifies the project stakeholders, describes the purpose of
        communication, and identifies the channels, frequencies and products for a given communication. </h4>
    <h4>Stakeholders include the funder, sponsor, regulatory agencies, investigators, research institutions and
        universities, study participants, local communities, their representatives, national or local government
        authorities, the scientific community or members of the public. </h4>

    <h4>The communication purpose outlines the specific objective of the information that will be communicated to
        stakeholders in relation to their roles and responsibilities.</h4>

    <h4>The medium for sharing information will include four main channels:</h4>

    <h5><em>E-mail:</em>
        The LAKANA project coordinator at TAU will set up lists of e-mail addresses for the different working groups for
        the sharing of documents and information. The rules for e-mail use are established to avoid overload of e-mails.
        It will be the responsibility of each partner to ensure that relevant personnel are included in the mailing
        lists and to communicate any changes to the project coordinator at TAU. Individual e-mails will be addressed to
        targeted stakeholder(s) as needed.</h5>

    <h5><em>Face-to-face/online meetings:</em> A <a href="http://www.zoom.com">Zoom</a> virtual meeting room will be
        used for
        accommodating online meetings. Face-to-face meetings will be organized as needed.</h5>

    <h5><em>Microsoft Teams and dropbox:</em> Microsoft Teams and dropbox are cloud-based collaboration softwares which
        allow members to collaborate and share information in real-time. The LAKANA project coordinator at TAU will set
        up distinct channels on the Teams platform and dropbox for the different working groups. All working groups will
        have dedicated files. Members can attach and send files, comment on documents and send direct messages to each
        other, and manage group schedules through Teams and dropbox.</h5>

    <h5><em>Website:</em> A website for the LAKANA Trial will be set up to share news and information with the
        scientific community and members of the public. The project coordinator at TAU will be responsible for website
        management.</h5>

    <h4>Communication material will include meeting agenda, meeting minutes, reports and any appropriate deliverables in
        relation to the communication purpose. </h4>

    <h4>The responsible party will facilitate communication with stakeholders and ensure that products are filed and/or
        disseminated to appropriate target groups.</h4>

    <h4>The communication plan for the LAKANA project is built on a project governance structure (Appendix 1) that
        presents the key stakeholders in the project, their roles and responsibilities.</h4>

    <h5>White rectangles depict the funder, sponsor, project steering group, external monitor, regulatory agencies,
        study participants and Malian interest groups.</h5>

    <h5>Green rectangles depict the research institutions involved in the LAKANA project, and ovals depict their main
        responsibility. Research activities will be coordinated at a working package (WP) level under the responsibility
        of one or two institutions acting as WP leader(s). They will coordinate the work within the individual WPs in
        close collaboration with the participating WP partners. They will report WP progress to the PSG.</h5>

    <h5>Blue rectangles depict WPs. A WP is a group of research-related tasks within the LAKANA project.</h5>
